NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is one of the most important foundational pack‐ages for numerical computing in Python. Most computational packages providing scientific functionality use NumPy’s array objects as the lingua franca for data exchange.

**Here are some of the things you’ll find in NumPy:**
• ndarray, an efficient multidimensional array providing fast array-oriented arith‐metic operations and flexible broadcasting capabilities.
• Mathematical functions for fast operations on entire arrays of data without having to write loops.
• Tools for reading/writing array data to disk and working with memory-mapped files.
• Linear algebra, random number generation, and Fourier transform capabilities.
• A C API for connecting NumPy with libraries written in C, C++, or FORTRAN.

Because NumPy provides an easy-to-use C API, it is straightforward to pass data to external libraries written in a low-level language and also for external libraries to return data to Python as NumPy arrays. This feature has made Python a language of choice for wrapping legacy C/C++/Fortran codebases and giving them a dynamic and easy-to-use interface. 

For most data analysis applications, the main areas of functionality I’ll focus on are:

• Fast vectorized array operations for data munging and cleaning, subsetting and filtering, transformation, and any other kinds of computations
• Common array algorithms like sorting, unique, and set operations
• Efficient descriptive statistics and aggregating/summarizing data
• Data alignment and relational data manipulations for merging and joining together heterogeneous datasets
• Expressing conditional logic as array expressions instead of loops with if-elifelse branches
• Group-wise data manipulations (aggregation, transformation, function application) 

One of the reasons NumPy is so important for numerical computations in Python is because it is designed for efficiency on large arrays of data. There are a number of reasons for this:

• NumPy internally stores data in a contiguous block of memory, independent of other built-in Python objects. NumPy’s library of algorithms written in the C language can operate on this memory without any type checking or other overhead. NumPy arrays also use much less memory than built-in Python sequences.
• NumPy operations perform complex computations on entire arrays without the
need for Python for loops.
