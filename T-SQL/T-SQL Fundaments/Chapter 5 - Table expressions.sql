-- The following query attempts to filter orders that were not placed on the last day of the year.
-- Itâ€™s supposed to return the order ID, order date, customer ID, employee ID, and respective end-of-year date for each order:


SELECT orderid, orderdate, custid, empid,
DATEFROMPARTS(YEAR(orderdate), 12, 31) AS endofyear
FROM Sales.Orders
WHERE orderdate <> endofyear;

-- When you try to run this query, you get the following error:
--Msg 207, Level 16, State 1, Line 233
--Invalid column name 'endofyear'.
--Explain what the problem is, and suggest a valid solution.

	FROM Sales.Orders
)

-- Write a query that returns rows with row numbers 11 through 20 based on the row-number definition in Exercise 3-1. Use a CTE to encapsulate the code from Exercise 3-1:
