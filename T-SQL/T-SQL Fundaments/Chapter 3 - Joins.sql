-- Tables involved: HR.Employees and dbo.Nums

-- Return customers and their orders, including customers who placed no orders:
-- Tables involved: Sales.Customers and Sales.Orders

SELECT c.custid, c.companyname, o.orderid, o.orderdate
FROM Sales.Customers AS c
LEFT JOIN Sales.Orders as o

-- Write a query that returns all customers in the output, but matches them with their respective orders only if they were placed on February 12, 2016:
-- Tables involved: Sales.Customers and Sales.Orders

SELECT c.custid, c.companyname, o.orderid, o.orderdate

SELECT C.custid, C.companyname, O.orderid, O.orderdate
FROM Sales.Customers AS C
LEFT OUTER JOIN Sales.Orders AS O
ON O.custid = C.custid
WHERE O.orderdate = '20160212'
OR O.orderid IS NULL;

-- Return all customers, and for each return a Yes/No value depending on whether the customer placed orders on February 12, 2016:
-- Tables involved: Sales.Customers and Sales.Orders

SELECT C.custid, C.companyname, CASE WHEN O.orderid IS NOT NULL THEN 'YES' ELSE 'NO' END AS hasorderon20160212
